## :memo: loxygenK/portfolio-2025
My latest portfolio! Still not refined very well though. I'll refine the details later.

#### Why did I publish a kinda-not-refined version?

TL:DR; I am impatient!

- I hadn't updated my portfolio since around 2022, and the information was so outdated that I had to take down and redirect https://f4n.dev to GitHub! I lost my unique way to introduct myself, so I wanted to revive it as soon as possible.
- The initial animation turned out awesome (thank you, anime.js, seriously), so I couldn't wait to share this magnum opus real quick.
- I learned that worrying too much can be waste of time so I decided to just publish it anyway.
